# Vale-Python-Text-Based-Game
Vale is a game which is programmed in Python. This project was made for a school project where we were assigned the task of making a text-based game in Python. It is designed to have three story acts, a quick time event system and ASCII art for each of the endings.

What I Learned
- User inputs (Name, Choices)
- Utilising graphics (ASCII art) in Python
- Altered outputs based on user inputs
